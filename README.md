# CSE502
As part of my  Coursework in Data Structures and Algorithms, I studied various simple data structures. 
I implemented several different algorithms as part of the assignments. Some Data stuctures that were implemented were Hash Tables
priority queues, avl trees, stacks.
I implemented the an algorithm for shortest path using Djikstras algorithm,
